# ArticleAggregator

## ArticleAggregator is a crowdsourced article recommendation chrome extentension that is completely open source. 
ArticleAggregator has been written to:

* Provide curated item similarities such as "Users that read this article or blog post also read ..."
* Provide personalized predictions based on a user's past history, such as "You read these 10 newsletters, so you might also like to read ..."

At the moment, ArticleAggregator extends the open source GER (Good Enough Recommendations) engine which uses the Jaccard index or the Sorenson-Dice coefficient to determine silarities between items.

The ArticleAggregator chrome extension allows users to enable passive scraping of certain websites/blogs (i.e. Substack, Medium, etc.) to store articles the like/dislike automatically and sends the user a curated list of new articles to read weekly.
